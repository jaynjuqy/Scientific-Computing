# Scientific Computing

## Assignment One: Python Basics
The source files can be found in the python-basics folder in source tree.

The objective of this exercise and what i learnt from it was how to use basic python datatypes, the importance
of code modularization by use of functions and also control structures like `for` loops and `while` loops
and `if...elif...else` statements.

## Assignment Two: Symbolic computing
Notebook is in the symbolic_computing folder in the source tree.

The objective of this exercise and what i learnt was to learn how to use various functions provided by the sympy
library to do symbolic computing effectively. These include operations such as factoring, differentation and
integral calculus, solving of expressions, just to name a few...This library is useful for such operations as it
saves on time, and also provides an efficient way to perform and learn symbolic computing in the process. 
The various functions provided are such as diff() for differentiation, solve() to solve for a variable in an algebraic
equation, factor() for factoring algebraic expressions, laplace_transform and inverse_laplace_transform() for laplacian
operations etc.

## Assignment Three: Data manipulation 
Notebook is in the data_manipulation folder in the source tree

The objective was to learn how to load data from a file, inspect it, manipulate it performing necessary operations, then
show a visualization of this data in such a way that is telling to the one reading it...Pandas and MatPlotLib were the
main libraries used for this exercise. They offer tools and functions for doing the necessary operations like reading from
files, manipulating these data and actually allowing for its visualization.

## Assignment Four: Python API
Notebook in the python_api folder in the source tree

Using the urllib.request, json and matplotlib, we fetch data from external apis, convert the data into json format and 
visualize it using matplotlib diagrams and charts. Here we utilize a football api and visualize the data using tables, 
bar graphs and pie charts.
