# Scientific Computing

### How to run:
>>Each of the files can be run using the command line Interface or a shell with the following command:
>>`python <filename>` for windows
>>`python3 <filename>` for linux and macOS

## Assignment One: Python Basics

The source files can be found in the python-basics folder in source tree.

## Assignment One: Python Basics
The source files can be found in the python-basics folder in source tree.

The objective of this exercise and what i learnt from it was how to use basic python datatypes, the importance
of code modularization by use of functions and also control structures like `for` loops and `while` loops
and `if...elif...else` statements.

## Assignment Two: Symbolic computing
Source files are in the symbolic_computing folder in the source tree.

The objective of this exercise and what i learnt was to learn how to use various functions provided by the sympy
library to do symbolic computing effectively. These include operations such as factoring, differentation and
integral calculus, solving of expressions, just to name a few...This library is useful for such operations as it
saves on time, and also provides an efficient way to perform and learn symbolic computing in the process. 
The various functions provided are such as diff() for differentiation, solve() to solve for a variable in an algebraic
equation, factor() for factoring algebraic expressions, laplace_transform and inverse_laplace_transform() for laplacian
operations etc.
