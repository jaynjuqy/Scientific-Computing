## Assignment One: Python Basics

The source files can be found in the python-basics folder in source tree.

### How to run:
>Each of the files can be run using the command line Interface or a shell with the following command:
>>`python <filename>` for windows and `python3 <filename>` for linux and macOS

**NOTE** that this requires you to be inside the python-basics folder, so you can run the files.

The objective of this exercise and what i learnt from it was how to use basic python datatypes, the importance
of code modularization by use of functions and also control structures like `for` loops and `while` loops
and `if...elif...else` statements
